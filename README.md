# SOC-Automation-Lab

## Objective

To automate security operations by creating a SOC using open-source tools like Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle. The goal is to streamline incident response, improve threat detection, and enhance overall security posture.

### Skills Learned

- Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR): Leveraging tools like Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle to automate security processes.
- Threat Detection and Response: Implementing detection mechanisms for threats like malware and privilege escalation.
- Log Analysis and Correlation: Using Wazuh to analyze security logs and identify anomalies.
- Incident Response: Creating automated workflows for incident response, including notification, investigation, and remediation.
- Security Automation: Scripting and automation techniques to streamline security tasks.
- Cloud Security: Configuring and securing cloud environments.
### Tools Used

- Wazuh: Used for security monitoring, log analysis, and threat detection.
- The Hive: Employed for case management and incident response orchestration.
- Shuffle: Utilized for security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR).
## Steps
## Step - 1 - System architecture

This diagram outlines the core components of the SOC automation system and their interactions:

Client Machines: Generate security events and send them to WAZI.

WAZI: Receives and processes security events, triggering alerts for significant incidents.

Shuffle: Enriches alerts and sends them to The Hive for case management.

The Hive: Creates cases for incidents and assigns tasks to SOC analysts.

SOC Analysts: Receive notifications and take necessary actions, such as investigating incidents or implementing countermeasures.

By automating these steps, the SOC can respond to threats more efficiently and effectively.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Virtual Environment

2A. Install Virtualization Software:
Download and install a virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware Workstation on your host machine.
